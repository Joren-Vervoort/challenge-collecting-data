## About the Repository

### Repository

**README.md**

**main.py**
  - this is where you start the program
  - everything that you need to start scrapping is imported here 
  
**utils folder**
  - this has 3 files namely:
      1. **requests.py**
          - this is where you get the requests for the data, we used Beautiful Soup to get the data from the website
          
      2. **getting_data.py**
          - this is where we convert the data that we got from requests.py and save it in a dataframe using pandas
      
**utils folder**
  - this contains 1 csv file:
      1. **ZimmoData.csv**
          - this is where the data is saved, it is in a csv format
          
## Pending...

We have a lot of ideas in mind, but due to limited time, we still have a lot of things that are not available.
